Hello!

My name is Felix and I'm very exited to launch this new blog.
I'm an undergraduate computer engineering student, currently pursuing my bachelor's thesis.

My goal with this blog is to present new developments in the world of embedded systems and teach you how to use them for yourself.

I've made the experience that actually diving deeper into a topic as dynamically changing as embedded systems can be tedious due to not knowing where to start.

Until then, I wish you all the best and I hope you enjoy the contents that follow in the future.
